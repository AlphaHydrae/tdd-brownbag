# Test-Driven Development Brownbag

This repository contains a basic setup to practice [Test-Driven
Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) with
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

## Requirements

* Node.js 12+

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlphaHydrae/tdd-brownbag.git
cd tdd-brownbag
npm ci
npm run test:all
```

Your browser should open at http://localhost:8080 and show the test coverage
report. It will update in real time as you write more tests and implement more
features.
